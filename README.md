# Next Notes :construction:

(WIP) Currently learning how to build a figma like canvas (probably with konva. j's) for the interactive part of the app (image a post-it board in the investigations movies, where it has a line between images and other post-its)

## How to run

> clone or fork the project
> rename .env.example to .env and give your own credentials
> yarn prisma generate and yarn prisma migrate dev
> yarn dev
> check localhost:3000

I will provide a docker compose file later for fast setup(mostly because the .env file).
